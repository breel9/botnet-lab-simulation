# Ahhh!!! The bots are netting 

This project simulates botnet activity using Empire C2 and analyzes attacker behavior across compromised endpoints. 

## Project Objectives
- Deploy a simulated botnet using Empire C2
- Capture command-and-control traffic
- Analyze attacker behavior through logs and PCAPs
- Visualize infection paths and endpoint compromise stages

## Tools & Technologies
- **Empire C2** – Command and control simulation
- **Wireshark** – Packet capture and analysis
- **Python** – Log parsing and basic threat detection
- **Vue.js** – Visualization dashboard (team-built)
- **PCAP files** – Collected for offline analysis
